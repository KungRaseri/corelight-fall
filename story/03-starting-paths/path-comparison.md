# Path Comparison - Two Roads to Truth

## Overview

The **Scavenger's Path** and **Seeker's Path** represent two philosophically different approaches to survival in the post-Fall world. Both eventually converge in the main story, but the journey to get there shapes the player character's perspective, skills, and relationships.

## Thematic Differences

### Scavenger's Path (Forgewalker)

**Core Question**: *Can humanity save itself through ingenuity and determination?*

**Philosophy**:
- Progress over tradition
- Innovation over restoration
- Pragmatism over idealism
- Prove worth through action
- Technology is humanity's salvation

**Tone**:
- Gritty and practical
- Morally grey choices
- Survival-focused
- Competitive environment
- "Earn your place"

**Emotional Arc**:
- Starts: Vulnerable, out of place
- Middle: Capable, earning respect
- End: Self-reliant, conflicted about costs

---

### Seeker's Path (Conclave)

**Core Question**: *Was the Fall punishment, accident, or something else entirely?*

**Philosophy**:
- Restoration over innovation
- Faith tempered by evidence
- Idealism with awareness of harsh reality
- Community over individual
- Divine technology must be understood, not just used

**Tone**:
- Hopeful but not naive
- Moral and ethical dilemmas
- Mystery-focused
- Supportive environment
- "You belong here"

**Emotional Arc**:
- Starts: Lost, seeking purpose
- Middle: Finding truth and community
- End: Understanding, questioning assumptions

## Moral Choices Comparison

### Scavenger's Path Choice Example

**"The Salvage Run"**

*A rival scavenger team is trapped in a collapsed building. They have valuable components. Time is running out.*

**Options**:
1. **Help them** - Rescue costs time/resources, gain respect but lose salvage
2. **Wait and watch** - Take salvage after they die/escape, pragmatic
3. **Negotiate** - Demand payment for rescue, business is business
4. **Set trap** - Cause further collapse, eliminate competition (evil)

**Consequences**:
- Affects Forgewalker reputation
- Changes Torren's opinion
- Rival team remembers
- Loot and reward variations

---

### Seeker's Path Choice Example

**"The Heretic's Text"**

*Brother Callum found a pre-Fall document that contradicts Conclave doctrine. He asks you to help hide it or reveal it.*

**Options**:
1. **Hide it** - Protect him and preserve community peace
2. **Reveal it** - Truth matters, even if painful
3. **Study it first** - Read it yourself before deciding
4. **Destroy it** - Some knowledge is too dangerous (extreme)

**Consequences**:
- Affects Conclave trust
- Impacts Aria's faith journey
- Unlocks/locks lore entries
- Future story variations

---

## Convergence Point

### "The Crossroads" Event (End of Act 1)

Both paths lead to the same revelation: **The fragments are awakening something**

**Scavenger's Path arrives via**:
- Tech monitoring detected energy spike
- Sent to investigate (paid job)
- Meets Conclave forces there
- Both groups want the source

**Seeker's Path arrives via**:
- Divine visions point to location
- Sent on holy mission
- Meets Forgewalker scavengers there
- Both groups claim it

**The Conflict**:
Neither side will back down. Player must choose:
- Side with starting faction
- Propose alliance
- Take source for themselves
- Destroy source to prevent conflict

**Result**:
Regardless of choice, larger threat emerges that forces cooperation. Both factions must acknowledge the other's value. Player becomes bridge between them.
