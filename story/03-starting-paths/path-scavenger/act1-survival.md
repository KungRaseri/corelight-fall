- **The Market** - Trading post, merchant stalls
- **The Barracks** - Sleeping quarters (earn your bunk)

- **Scrap Yards** - Sorted salvage materials
- **The Proving Grounds** - Arena for testing and training

## Quest 1: "Welcome to the Forge"

### Arrival

**SCENE**: You approach the gates. Guards level weapons until you show Ravenwood's token.

**GUARD CAPTAIN MIRA**: "Ravenwood sent you?" *[Examines token]* "Huh. First time he's vouched for anyone in... five years?" *[Lowers weapon]* "Alright, greenhorn. Welcome to the Forge. Don't steal, don't start fights you can't finish, and pull your weight. You'll do fine."

*[Gates open revealing the bustling settlement]*

**OBJECTIVE**: Find Torren Blackforge

### The Workshop

Navigate through the settlement. Environmental storytelling:
- Workers arguing over salvage rights
- Someone getting thrown out for theft
- Sparks flying from welding stations
- Children learning to sort scrap
- Trading happening everywhere

**At the main forge, find Torren**: 

**TORREN BLACKFORGE**: *[Doesn't look up from his work]* "If you're here to sell something, talk to the merchants. If you're here to beg, get lost. If you're here to work... what can you do?"

**[First Dialogue Tree]**

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
1. **[Show token]** "Ravenwood sent me."
2. **[Confident]** "I can handle myself. Whatever you need."
3. **[Honest]** "I'm new to this. But I learn fast."
4. **[Fragment]** "I have something you might want to see."

### Torren's Response

**If showed token**:
"Ravenwood." *[Finally looks up]* "That old bastard owes me a favor. Sending you is probably his way of paying it back." *[Assessing look]* "You don't look like much. We'll see."

**If confident**:
*[Laughs, not kindly]* "Everyone thinks that. Then the Rust Fields chew them up." *[Points to scar on his face]* "Got this being cocky. You'll learn. Question is whether you survive the lesson."

**If honest**:
*[Slight nod]* "At least you're not stupid enough to lie. Honesty's rare here. Might keep you alive." *[Puts down tools]* "Let's see what you've got."

**If showed fragment**:
*[Eyes widen, quickly grabs your wrist, pulls you aside]* "Are you insane? You don't flash a Navigator Fragment in public." *[Lowered voice]* "Get it out of sight. Now. We'll talk about this later."

## Quest 2: "The First Test"

### Assignment

**TORREN**: "You want a bunk? Food? Supplies? You earn them. First test: Simple salvage run. Collapsed warehouse, eastern sector. Bring back working components - circuits, power cells, anything intact. You get 40% of the value."

**PLAYER**: "40%? That seems low."

**TORREN**: "You're unproven. No reputation. Be glad it's not 20%. Do good work, percentage goes up. That's how it works here."

**[Quest items provided]**:
- Basic salvage tools
- Empty backpack
- Map marker to warehouse
- Warning: "Watch for Hollowed"

### The Warehouse

**Location**: Collapsed pre-Fall electronics factory

**Challenges**:
1. **Environmental hazards** - Unstable floors, exposed wiring
2. **Hollowed enemies** - 2-3 weak ones, avoidable if stealthy
3. **Resource management** - Limited inventory, choose what to take
4. **Locked areas** - Can break locks (destroy contents) or pick them (Finesse check)

**Loot available**:
- Common components (low value, heavy)
- Rare circuit boards (high value, light)
- Power cells (medium value, quest items)
- Personal effects (no monetary value, lore significance)
- Corrupted fragment (dangerous, valuable)

### The Choice

**ENCOUNTER**: Find another scavenger, injured, trapped under debris

**INJURED SCAVENGER - LYNN**: "Help... please. My leg. Can't move."

**[EXAMINE]**: She's badly hurt. Bleeding. Won't survive long without help.

**[EXAMINE HER PACK]**: Contains valuable components. Rare stuff.

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Help her]** - Use bandages, free her, share loot fairly
2. **[Take her pack]** - Grab valuable loot, leave her
3. **[Partial help]** - Give bandage, take half her loot
4. **[Mercy kill]** - End her suffering, take everything

**CONSEQUENCES**:

**If helped fully**:
- Lynn survives, remembers kindness
- Split loot (less value this run)
- Torren: "Soft, but honorable. Some here will respect that."
- Lynn becomes merchant contact later (+10% sell value)

**If took pack**:
- Lynn dies (guilt/no guilt depending on player)
- Full loot value
- Torren: "Smart. Cold, but smart. You'll fit in."
- Reputation as ruthless (affects some interactions)

**If partial help**:
- Lynn survives but bitter
- Decent loot
- Torren: "Practical compromise. Most common choice here."
- Lynn neutral, no special relationship

**If mercy kill**:
- Lynn dies (ends suffering)
- Full loot + moral complexity
- Torren: "Dark choice. But kinder than leaving her for the Hollowed."
- Some NPCs respect this, others fear you

## Quest 3: "Earning Your Place"

### Return to Forge

**TORREN**: *[Examines salvage]* "Not bad. Efficient choices. You've got an eye for value." *[Counts out gold]* "Here's your 40%. Don't spend it all in one place."

**[PAYMENT: Based on loot returned]**

**TORREN**: "You've got potential. But potential gets you killed if you don't sharpen it. Tomorrow, real work begins."

**OBJECTIVE**: Spend gold wisely before next assignment

**SHOPPING OPTIONS**:

**At the Market**:
- Better backpack (+10 inventory)
- Upgraded tools (improve salvage quality)
- Weapons (iron sword, crossbow)
- Armor (light, medium options)
- Healing items (bandages, tonics)
- Lockpicks (for better looting)

**MERCHANT TIP**: "New here? Get a weapon first. Everything else is useless if you're dead."

### Evening - The Barracks

**SCENE**: Communal dining area. Forgewalkers eating, trading stories.

**KESS "SPARKPLUG"** approaches:

**KESS**: "You're the newbie Torren picked up?" *[Looks you over]* "Huh. Thought you'd be taller." *[Grins]* "Name's Kess. I run salvage crew Delta. Best in the Forge."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
1. **[Friendly]** "Nice to meet you, Kess."
2. **[Competitive]** "Best? We'll see about that."
3. **[Dismissive]** "That's great. I'm eating."
4. **[Curious]** "What makes your crew the best?"

**KESS RELATIONSHIP START**: This interaction sets tone

**If friendly**: "You seem alright. I'll show you the ropes."
**If competitive**: "Ooh, I like you. This'll be fun."
**If dismissive**: "Suit yourself, greenhorn."
**If curious**: "Results. We bring back the goods. Simple as that."

## Quest 4: "The Deep Salvage"

### Three Days Later

**TORREN**: "Time for your real test. Deep salvage - underground sector of the old district. Dangerous. Pays well. You're coming with my crew."

**CREW INTRODUCTION**:

**TORREN** - Leader, heavy weapons
**REED** - Scout, quiet, observant
**BOOMER** - Demolitions, talks too much
**YOU** - Newest member, on trial

### The Mission

**OBJECTIVE**: Retrieve power cores from subterranean vault

**LOCATION**: The Undercity - old transit system beneath ruins

**JOURNEY DOWN**:
- Descend through old subway stations
- Environmental hazards - flooding, collapse risk
- Hollowed encounters - more dangerous variants
- Team dynamics on display

**BOOMER**: "First time in the deep, newbie? Stay close. These tunnels eat people."

**REED**: *[Silent warning gesture - danger ahead]*

**TORREN**: "Eyes sharp. Something doesn't feel right."

### The Ambush

**ENCOUNTER**: Rival scavenger crew has same target

**RIVAL LEADER - CADE**: "Torren. Should've known you'd show up."

**TORREN**: "Cade. Didn't know your crew was still operational after the last disaster."

**CADE**: "We're here first. The vault's ours."

**STANDOFF**:

**[PLAYER CHOICE INFLUENCES OUTCOME]**

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Negotiate]** Presence check - Suggest splitting the haul
2. **[Intimidate]** Nerve check - Threaten them into backing down
3. **[Ambush]** Guile check - Signal team to flank them
4. **[Defer to Torren]** Let him decide

**OUTCOMES**:

**If negotiated successfully**:
- Split loot 60/40
- Peaceful resolution
- Torren: "Diplomatic. Unusual here, but effective."
- Cade remembers this (ally potential later)

**If intimidated successfully**:
- They back down, keep all loot
- Torren: "Strong play. They'll think twice next time."
- Made enemies (combat encounter later)

**If ambushed successfully**:
- Surprise advantage, easy combat
- Torren: "Ruthless and smart. I approve."
- Major reputation as dangerous

**If deferred**:
- Torren fights, you support
- Standard loot split
- Torren: "You trust my judgment. Good."

### The Vault

**DISCOVERY**: Power cores present, but also something else

**TORREN**: "What the... that's not on the manifest."

**[A large Corelight fragment, pulsing with energy]**

**BOOMER**: "Boss, that thing is worth more than a year of salvage."

**TORREN**: *[To player]* "You've been quiet about your fragment. Time to talk. What do you know about these?"

**[TRUTH MOMENT]**

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Honest]** Tell him everything - visions, Navigator Fragment, memory gaps
2. **[Partial truth]** Admit you have one, not details
3. **[Lie]** Play ignorant
4. **[Show him]** Reveal your fragment

**TORREN'S REACTION**:

**If honest**:
"That... explains some things. Navigator Fragments are legend. If you really have one..." *[Pauses]* "We need to talk to Magistrate Venn. Now."

**If partial truth**:
"Not telling me everything. Smart or stupid, hard to say." *[Considers]* "Fine. Keep your secrets. For now."

**If lied**:
*[Doesn't believe you]* "Right. And I'm a Luminarch." *[Shakes head]* "Your business. But if it gets my crew killed, we're done."

**If showed**:
*[Sharp intake of breath]* "By the broken Core..." *[Looks at you differently]* "Do you understand what you're carrying? That's... that's world-changing."

### The Escape

**COMPLICATION**: Vault fragment's energy attracts Hollowed - a LOT of them

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Running battle through tunnels

**TEAM DYNAMICS**:
- Boomer sets charges to collapse tunnel behind you
- Reed scouts safe path
- Torren covers retreat
- YOU must choose how to help

**[COMBAT CHOICES AFFECT TEAM OPINION]**

**ESCAPE RESULT**: 
- Make it back to Forge with power cores
- Vault fragment left behind (too dangerous to move)
- Team survived (unless player made terrible choices)

## Quest 5: "The Magistrate's Offer"

### Summoned

**MAGISTRATE VENN**: "Torren tells me you've proven capable. More importantly, you carry something... special."

**SCENE**: Venn's office. Maps, blueprints, fragments behind glass.

**VENN**: "Navigator Fragments are myths to most. But I know better. I've been searching for one for years." *[Leans forward]* "I'll be direct. I want to buy it from you. Name your price."

**[MAJOR CHOICE]**

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Sell it]** Massive gold payment, lose Fragment and abilities
2. **[Refuse]** Keep Fragment, Venn annoyed but accepts
3. **[Negotiate]** What can you offer besides gold?
4. **[Threaten]** Try to take it and see what happens

**VENN'S RESPONSES**:

**If sell**:
"Smart. Practical. Here's your payment." *[Gives 5000 gold]* "Pleasure doing business." [END THIS PATH'S UNIQUE STORYLINE]

**If refuse**:
"Disappointing but predictable." *[Sighs]* "Very well. But know that fragment makes you a target. Every faction wants them. You'll need protection."

**If negotiate**:
"Clever. I can offer knowledge, resources, protection. What do you want?"
[Opens special shop, faction support, information about fragments]

**If threaten**:
*[Laughs]* "Bold. Stupid, but bold. I could take it by force. But that would make you useless to me alive. And I think you might be useful."

### The Proposition

**VENN** (if still have fragment): "I have a proposal. Work for me. Use that fragment to find others. I'll provide equipment, backup, fair compensation. You bring me fragments, I'll tell you what they mean. Deal?"

**[ACCEPT or REFUSE]**

**If ACCEPT**: Become Venn's special operative (unique questline)
**If REFUSE**: Remain independent Forgewalker (standard questline)

## Act 1 Ending: "Attack on the Forge"

### The Warning

**[MAJOR COMBAT ENCOUNTER]**

### The Siege

**OBJECTIVE**: Defend the Forge from waves of corrupted creatures

**ENCOUNTERS**:
- Wave 1: Corrupted wolves and deer
- Wave 2: Twisted plant creatures  
- Wave 3: Massive corrupted bear (mini-boss)

**[PLAYER CHOICES DURING BATTLE]**

**CRITICAL MOMENT**: 
Breach in eastern wall. Children and non-combatants at risk.

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Defend the breach]** Save civilians, miss final boss
2. **[Join main fight]** Help take down bear, civilians endangered
3. **[Split the difference]** Try to do both (very difficult)

### Aftermath

**RESULTS**:
- Forge damaged but standing
- Casualties (number depends on choices)
- Venn: "This was no random attack. Someone drove them here."

**TORREN**: *[If you fought well]* "You're one of us now. Proved it in blood."
