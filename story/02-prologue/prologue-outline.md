# Prologue - The Awakening

## Structure Overview

The prologue serves multiple purposes:
1. **Introduce the world** - Show the post-Fall reality
2. **Establish tone** - Dark fantasy, mystery, survival
3. **Create player investment** - Personal stakes from the start
4. **Tutorial mechanics** - Teach basic gameplay naturally
5. **Present meaningful choice** - The first path split

## Three-Act Prologue

### Act 1: Awakening (10-15 minutes)
**Setting**: A collapsed building in the ruins of a dead city

The player character regains consciousness in darkness, buried under rubble. They have no memory of how they got here or what happened. Through environmental storytelling and fragmented visions, they piece together recent events.

**Gameplay**:
- Simple movement and interaction
- Environmental observation
- First skill check (Vigor - to lift debris)
- Discovery of basic items

**Narrative Goals**:
- Establish amnesia/mystery hook
- Show the dangerous world
- Introduce Corelight fragments
- Create immediate survival tension

### Act 2: Escape (15-20 minutes)
**Setting**: Navigating through the ruined building to the surface

The player must escape the crumbling structure while avoiding hazards and encountering their first corrupted creature. They find evidence of what they were doing before losing consciousness.

**Gameplay**:
- Combat tutorial (basic encounter)
- Inventory management
- Environmental hazards
- Choice-based skill checks

**Narrative Goals**:
- Show the Corruption's effects
- Introduce combat stakes
- Build environmental storytelling
- Present moral choice (save stranger or take supplies)

### Act 3: The Choice (10-15 minutes)
**Setting**: The ruins' outskirts, first glimpse of the wider world

Having escaped, the player encounters two different groups of survivors, each offering help but pulling them in different directions. This choice determines their starting path.

**Gameplay**:
- Dialogue system introduction
- Faction introduction
- Character customization finalization
- Path selection (disguised as natural choice)

**Narrative Goals**:
- Introduce factions organically
- Present meaningful first choice
- Set up two distinct starting experiences
