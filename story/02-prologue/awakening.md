# Prologue: Awakening - Detailed Script

## Opening Sequence

### FADE IN

**[SCREEN: Complete darkness. Sound only]**

```
SOUND: Muffled, as if underwater. Distant creaking. Falling debris.
HEARTBEAT: Slow, steady, growing louder.
BREATHING: Ragged, panicked.
```

**[TEXT appears slowly, fading in and out]**

```
Cold...
Dark...
Can't... breathe...
Where... am I?
```

**[First player input: Press any key to continue]**

## Scene 1: Buried Alive

**[Vision slowly clears to dim, dusty darkness. Rubble visible in dim blue light]**

**NARRATOR**: *Your eyes open to darkness and dust. Something heavy pins your legs. The air is thick with ash and the metallic tang of blood - yours or someone else's, you can't tell.*

**EXAMINE SURROUNDINGS** (automatic tutorial)
- Broken concrete slabs above
- Twisted metal beams
- Faint blue glow coming from... something nearby
- Crushed furniture and personal belongings
- Blood on the rocks (fresh)

**PLAYER THOUGHT**: *How long have I been here? Minutes? Hours? Days?*

**[Tutorial prompt: Use WASD or Arrow keys to look around]**

**[Tutorial prompt: Press E to interact with objects]**

---

## Scene 2: First Struggle

**NARRATOR**: *You try to move. Pain lances through your leg. Not broken - you've felt broken bones before - but trapped. The debris shifts ominously above you.*

**[SKILL CHECK: Vigor 10]**

**SUCCESS**: 
*With a surge of desperate strength, you shift the rubble enough to pull your leg free. Something tears - cloth, skin, doesn't matter - you're loose.*

**FAILURE**: 
*You strain against the weight but it's too much. Have to find another way. There - if you can reach that metal beam, use it as a lever...*

**[If failed, second check: Ingenuity 8]**

**CRITICAL FAILURE (if both fail)**:
*Panic sets in. You thrash against the debris. Something shifts - wrong way. More rubble falls. The blue light gets brighter as debris tumbles away, revealing its source.*

---

## Scene 3: The Fragment

**NARRATOR**: *The blue glow intensifies. Through the settling dust, you see it: a crystalline shard, roughly the size of your fist, pulsing with inner light. Even from here, you feel its warmth, its... awareness?*

**[Tutorial: Inventory system]**

**INTERACTION: Examine the Corelight Fragment**

*It's beautiful and terrifying. Faceted crystal that seems to contain a captured star. The pulse matches your heartbeat - or is your heart matching its rhythm?*

**[Choice: Touch the fragment?]**
- **Touch it** → Visions and power gain
- **Leave it** → Miss visions but safer start

---

### If player touches fragment

**NARRATOR**: *The moment your fingers brush the crystal, the world WHITES OUT.*

**[VISION SEQUENCE - Rapid flashes]**

```
FLASH: A massive tower of light touching the sky
FLASH: Floating cities, beautiful and pristine  
FLASH: A face - humanoid but radiant, not quite human - looking down with concern
FLASH: The tower SHATTERING, reality tearing apart
FLASH: Screaming, falling, dying
FLASH: A laboratory? Strange equipment. People in white coats.
FLASH: A woman's face, desperate: "You have to remember! When you wake up—"
FLASH: Darkness. Injection. Sleep.
FLASH: YOUR FACE in a mirror - but different, younger, unfamiliar
```

**[Vision ends abruptly]**

**NARRATOR**: *You gasp, stumbling back. The fragment falls from your grip but... it doesn't fall. It hovers, rotating slowly, then drifts toward you and settles into your palm. Warm. Waiting.*

**[Fragment absorbed: +1 Sync, unlocked Relic slot]**

**PLAYER THOUGHT**: *What... what was that? Those places, those people... are they memories? But they can't be mine. I would remember... wouldn't I?*

---

### If player leaves fragment

**NARRATOR**: *Something about it feels dangerous. Wrong. You've survived this long by trusting your instincts. Whatever that thing is, it can wait.*

**[Later, after escaping the rubble, player finds another fragment - can't avoid it entirely]**

---

## Scene 4: Discovery

**NARRATOR**: *Free from the rubble, you take stock. You're in what was once a building - office? Apartment? Hard to tell. The walls are cracked, ceiling partially collapsed, everything covered in years of dust and ash.*

**[TUTORIAL: Search and loot]**

**AVAILABLE ITEMS**:
- Rusty iron pipe (weapon)
- Torn backpack (inventory space)
- 2x bandages (healing items)
- Flashlight (broken, needs battery)
- Journal (partially burned)

**EXAMINE JOURNAL**:

```
[Most pages are burned or water-damaged, but fragments remain]

"...Day 47 of the expedition. We're getting close. The readings 
are off the charts. If we can just..."

[Page torn]

"...don't trust Markus. He's hiding something. The fragment we 
found, it's not like the others. It shows me things. Impossible 
things. Or... memories?"

[Blood stain obscures next section]

"...if you're reading this, I'm probably dead. The fragment is 
hidden in the..."

[End of legible text]
```

**PLAYER THOUGHT**: *Was this my journal? The handwriting looks familiar, but I can't be sure. And who is Markus?*

---

## Scene 5: First Horror

**[SOUND: Distant scraping. Movement in the darkness ahead.]**

**NARRATOR**: *You freeze. Something is moving in the next room. Slow, dragging footsteps. A wet, rattling breath.*

**[Tutorial: Stealth or combat choice]**

**OPTION 1: Sneak past** 
- Requires Finesse or Guile check
- Safer but miss potential loot

**OPTION 2: Investigate**
- See the creature
- Potential combat or dialogue
- More information

**OPTION 3: Make noise to lure it away**
- Requires Presence or Ingenuity check
- Clears path but alerts other dangers

---

### If player investigates

**NARRATOR**: *You peer around the doorframe. The thing that was once human shambles through the wreckage. Its skin has a grayish pallor, veins black and visible beneath. Eyes: empty, milky white. It's searching for something, moving with terrible purpose.*

**[First encounter with a Hollowed]**

**EXAMINE (from safety)**: *This was a person once. You can see the remnants - a torn Forgewalker uniform, a name badge too corroded to read. The Corruption took everything that made them human and left... this.*

**[Creature notices player]**

**HOLLOWED**: *[Inhuman shriek]*

**[COMBAT TUTORIAL - Basic attack, defend, use item]**

**COMBAT NOTES**:
- This is a weakened Hollowed, tutorial enemy
- Can be defeated with basic attacks
- Teaches blocking/dodging
- Introduces stamina system

**AFTER COMBAT**:

**NARRATOR**: *It falls, finally still. You search the body - trying not to think about who they might have been.*

**LOOT**:
- 15 gold
- Battery (for flashlight)
- Conclave medallion (lore item)

**PLAYER THOUGHT**: *Is this what happens to everyone eventually? The Corruption takes us all in the end? Or was there something we could have done...*

---

## Scene 6: Escape Route

**NARRATOR**: *With the flashlight working, you can see a way forward. A partially collapsed stairwell leads up - toward daylight, you hope. But the structure is unstable. Every step could be your last.*

**[Environmental challenge: Climbing sequence]**

**OBSTACLES**:
1. Weak floorboards (Finesse check or slow careful movement)
2. Blocked passage (Vigor to move debris or find alternate route)
3. Sudden collapse (Quick-time event or reflex save)

**[At the top of the stairs]**

**NARRATOR**: *You emerge onto what was once a rooftop. The ash-choked sky stretches above, the sun a dim red circle through the haze. In the distance, you see the remnants of the world that was - broken skyscrapers, crashed sky-islands, the faint glow of settlement fires.*

**[First vista view of the shattered world]**

**PLAYER THOUGHT**: *Three hundred years since the Fall, they say. Three centuries of survival, scavenging, hoping. And still, we endure. But for what?*

---

## Scene 7: The Voice

**[SOUND: Stone falling behind player]**

**UNKNOWN VOICE (male, rough)**: "Don't. Move."

**NARRATOR**: *You turn slowly. A man stands in the doorway you just came through. Mid-40s, scarred, wearing patchwork armor. A crossbow is leveled at your chest. His eyes flick to your hands - specifically, to the glowing fragment you're holding.*

**RAVENWOOD**: "The fragment. Put it down. Slowly."

**[DIALOGUE CHOICE - First conversation tree]**

**OPTIONS**:
1. **[Aggressive]** "Come and take it." (Requires Nerve check)
2. **[Diplomatic]** "Let's talk about this. No need for violence." (Requires Presence check)
3. **[Deceptive]** "Fragment? I just found this thing. You can have it." (Requires Guile check)
4. **[Curious]** "Who are you? How did you find me?" (Neutral, information gathering)

---

### Dialogue Path 1: Aggressive

**PLAYER**: "Come and take it."

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Tightens grip on crossbow]* "Don't be stupid. I've killed for less, and I'll sleep fine tonight."

**[Nerve check: 12]**
- **SUCCESS**: He lowers the weapon slightly, reassessing
- **FAILURE**: He fires (grazing shot, -5 HP, but doesn't pursue)

---

### Dialogue Path 2: Diplomatic

**PLAYER**: "Let's talk about this. No need for violence."

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Doesn't lower weapon but doesn't fire]* "Talk fast."

**PLAYER**: "I just woke up in that building. Don't even remember how I got here. If this fragment is valuable, maybe we can work something out?"

**[Presence check: 10]**
- **SUCCESS**: He lowers the crossbow. "You're either a good liar or genuinely lost. Either way..." 
- **FAILURE**: "Nice try. Fragment. Now."

---

### Dialogue Path 3: Deceptive

**PLAYER**: "Fragment? I just found this thing. You can have it."

**[Guile check: 11]**
- **SUCCESS**: You make a show of extending it, then use the moment to create distance
- **FAILURE**: He sees through it. "I wasn't born yesterday. Last chance."

---

### Dialogue Path 4: Curious (Recommended path)

**PLAYER**: "Who are you? How did you find me?"

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Surprised at the question]* "Name's Ravenwood. And I didn't find you - I've been tracking that fragment for three days. Didn't expect to find someone alive holding it."

**PLAYER**: "Why? What's special about this one?"

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Hesitates]* "You really don't know, do you?" *[Lowers crossbow slightly]* "That's not just any shard. That's a Navigator Fragment. Rare. Powerful. Worth more than this entire ruin."

---

## Scene 8: Interrupted

**[SOUND: Multiple creatures shrieking in distance, getting closer]**

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Curses]* "The Hollowed heard the commotion. We need to move. Now."

**[Whether hostile or friendly, he heads for the fire escape]**

**RAVENWOOD**: "You want to live? Follow me. We can settle this later."

**[CHOICE]**:
- **Follow him** → leads to encounter with Conclave group
- **Go your own way** → leads to encounter with Forgewalker scavengers
- **Stand and fight** → difficult combat, but gain XP and loot

---

## End of Awakening Sequence

**NARRATOR**: *Whatever choice you make, one thing is clear: You're not alone in this ruined world. The fragment you carry is valuable. People will kill for it. And somewhere in your missing memories lies the truth about who you are - and what you were doing here.*

**[CHECKPOINT SAVE]**

**[TRANSITION TO: "The First Choice" - Path Selection Scene]**
