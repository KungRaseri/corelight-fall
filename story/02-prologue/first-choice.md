# The First Choice - Path Divergence

## Context

After the awakening sequence, players make their first major choice that determines their starting path. This choice feels organic and natural, not like a menu selection, but has significant impact on the early game experience.

## The Encounter

### Location: The Outskirts
*Ravenwood has led you through winding streets and collapsed buildings. The Hollowed are still searching, their cries echoing through the ruins. You emerge at a junction: a crumbled highway overpass.*

---

## The Situation

**RAVENWOOD**: "This is where we part ways." *[Gestures to two different directions]* "South, there's a Conclave outpost. They'll take you in, ask questions later. Good people, mostly. Just... devout."

*[Points east]*

"East, there's a Forgewalker salvage camp. Rougher crowd, but they pay for information. And that fragment you're carrying?" *[Whistles]* "They'd give you enough gear to survive a month."

**PLAYER**: "What about you?"

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Smirks]* "I'm Free Drifter through and through. No camps, no factions. But you? You're too green to survive alone. Not yet." *[Pauses]* "Unless..."

**[CHOICE EMERGES]**

---

## Choice 1: Questions About The Paths

**PLAYER**: "Tell me more about these groups."

### About the Conclave

**RAVENWOOD**: "Conclave believes the Luminarchs - the divine beings from before the Fall - are still out there. Still watching. They collect fragments to 'rebuild the Corelight' and bring paradise back."

*[Shrugs]* 

"Naive? Maybe. But they've got food, medicine, and they won't stab you in your sleep. Sister Aria runs that outpost. She's genuine. Almost too kind for this world."

**REPUTATION**: Ravenwood has neutral/positive view of Conclave

### About the Forgewalkers

**RAVENWOOD**: "Forgewalkers are builders. Inventors. They think humanity can tech their way out of this mess. No gods needed, thank you very much."

*[Grins]*

"I respect that. They're practical. But they're also cutthroat. Everything's a transaction. You help them, they help you. Cross them..." *[Makes cutting gesture]* "Well. Don't."

**REPUTATION**: Ravenwood has complicated relationship with Forgewalkers

### About Going Alone

**RAVENWOOD**: "You could come with me. Learn the Drifter way. It's harder, lonelier, but you answer to no one. Freedom has a price, though. And in this world, most can't afford it."

*[Studies you]*

"You've got potential. That fragment chose you for a reason. But raw potential gets you killed if you don't know how to use it."

---

## The Three Paths

### Path A: Scavenger's Path (Forgewalker Route)

**CHOICE**: "I'll head to the Forgewalker camp."

**RAVENWOOD**: "Smart. Practical. You'll fit right in." *[Hands you a gear-shaped token]* "Show them this. Tell them Ravenwood sent you. That'll get you in the door. What you do after that is up to you."

**THEMES**: 
- Survival through ingenuity
- Technology and crafting
- Moral pragmatism
- Self-reliance
- Trading and economics

**GAMEPLAY FOCUS**:
- Learn crafting systems early
- Focus on technology and gear
- More combat-oriented
- Resource management emphasis
- Faction reputation via work

**STARTING LOCATION**: The Forge - Outpost 7 (salvage camp in Rust Fields)

**KEY NPC**: Torren Blackforge - Scarred engineer, pragmatic leader

---

### Path B: Seeker's Path (Conclave Route)

**CHOICE**: "I'll try the Conclave outpost."

**RAVENWOOD**: "May the light guide you and all that." *[Not mocking, just matter-of-fact]* "Sister Aria is good people. Tell her... tell her Ravenwood still remembers her kindness." 

*[Looks away, then back]*

"They'll want to know about your fragment. My advice? Be honest. They can always tell when you're lying anyway."

**THEMES**:
- Mystery and divine truth
- Faith vs evidence
- Community and belonging
- Healing and redemption
- Ancient secrets

**GAMEPLAY FOCUS**:
- Lore and story discovery
- Magic and divine abilities
- Dialogue and relationships
- Exploration and puzzles
- Moral choices and redemption

**STARTING LOCATION**: The Sanctum - Outpost Serenity (fortified monastery)

**KEY NPC**: Sister Aria Lightbringer - Compassionate cleric, true believer

---

### Path C: Drifter's Path (Independent Route)

**CHOICE**: "I'd rather travel with you. Learn from you."

**RAVENWOOD**: *[Surprised, then approving]* "Huh. Didn't expect that." *[Nods slowly]* "Alright. But I don't do charity. You pull your weight, we split everything 50-50, and you follow my lead until you know what you're doing."

*[Extends hand]*

"Deal?"

**THEMES**:
- Survival and adaptability  
- Freedom and independence
- Learning through experience
- Neutral morality
- Jack-of-all-trades

**GAMEPLAY FOCUS**:
- Balanced approach to all systems
- Learn from mentor
- More exploration
- Encounter variety
- No faction pressure early

**STARTING LOCATION**: Mobile - traveling with Ravenwood

**KEY NPC**: Ravenwood - Experienced Drifter, mysterious past

---

## Path Integration Point

**IMPORTANT**: All three paths converge later in Act 2 of the main story. The different starting experiences give players unique perspectives, skills, and relationships, but eventually they'll all face the same core mysteries.

**Timeline to Convergence**: 6-8 hours of gameplay

## After The Choice

**RAVENWOOD**: "One more thing." *[Looks serious]* "That fragment you're carrying? Guard it. Don't show it to just anyone. And if someone named Markus comes asking questions..." *[Pauses]* "Run."

**PLAYER**: "Who is Markus?"

**RAVENWOOD**: "Someone best avoided. Trust me on that."

**[He turns to leave, then stops]**

**RAVENWOOD**: "Oh, and... welcome to the shattered world, Drifter. Try not to die."

## Transition

### To Scavenger's Path
*You head east, through fields of rusted machinery and collapsed factories. In the distance, smoke rises from the Forgewalker camp...*

### To Seeker's Path
*You head south, toward the distant glow of protected fires. The Conclave's symbol - a sunburst within a shield - marks the way...*

**→ Continue to: `path-seeker/act1-discovery.md`**

### To Drifter's Path
*Ravenwood leads you west, into territory unmarked on any map. "First lesson," he says, "is knowing when to trust your instincts..."*

## Design Notes

**Why This Works**:
1. **No Wrong Choice** - All paths are valid and interesting
2. **Natural Integration** - Feels like story, not menu
3. **Replayability** - Different enough to warrant multiple playthroughs
4. **Character Consistency** - All choices make sense for an amnesiac survivor
5. **Meaningful Difference** - Not just cosmetic, genuinely different experiences

**Implementation Tips**:
- Track player choice in save data
- Load appropriate starting quests
- Set initial faction reputation
- Assign starting location
- Provide path-specific items
- Unlock related achievements

**Convergence Planning**:
- Paths meet at "The Crossroads" story event
- Players can experience other path content through side quests
- Final story independent of starting path
- Companions from other paths can be recruited later
