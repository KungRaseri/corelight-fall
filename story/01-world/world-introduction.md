# The Corelight Fall - World Introduction

## The World Before

### The Age of Radiance

In an age now called **The Radiance**, the world thrived under the guidance of divine beings known as the **Luminarchs**. These god-like entities channeled pure energy through a massive crystalline structure called the **Corelight** - a towering pillar of divine technology that rose from the heart of the world, reaching into the heavens.

The Corelight was more than a monument; it was the heart of civilization:
- **Power Source**: Provided limitless clean energy to all nations
- **Communication Hub**: Connected minds across vast distances
- **Healing Nexus**: Radiated life-giving energy that cured disease and extended lifespans
- **Weather Control**: Maintained perfect climate balance across the world
- **Knowledge Repository**: Stored the collective wisdom of all civilizations

Humanity flourished in floating cities and sprawling metropolises, seamlessly blending arcane magic with divine technology. The Luminarchs taught humanity to harness both:
- **Sync Technology**: Divine circuits that responded to thought and will
- **Arcane Weaving**: Ancient magic passed down through bloodlines
- **Hybrid Crafting**: Fusion of spell and circuit, soul and silicon

## The Cataclysm

### The Fall

Three hundred years ago, on a day remembered only as **The Sundering**, everything changed in an instant.

The Corelight **shattered**.

No warning. No prophecy fulfilled. No gradual decline. One moment, the pillar of divine light stood eternal. The next, it erupted in a cataclysmic explosion that tore reality itself.

**What happened in those first moments:**
- The Corelight fractured into millions of pieces, scattering across the world
- Floating cities plummeted from the sky, killing millions
- The Luminarchs vanished - some say they died, others claim they fled
- Divine technology went dark, leaving billions without power
- Reality warped in places, creating zones of temporal and spatial anomalies
- The **Corruption** began - a creeping rot that twisted life and land

**The immediate aftermath:**
- 80% of the population died in the first year
- Survivors formed desperate enclaves in the ruins
- Magic became unstable, dangerous, unpredictable
- Technology that once responded to thoughts now required manual operation
- The sky itself changed - permanently overcast, with an ashen haze

## The World Now

### The Shattered Lands

The world is no longer one cohesive realm. The Fall broke it into distinct regions, each scarred in different ways:

**The Fragments** - Floating landmasses where cities once soared, now crashed and crumbling, suspended at various heights by residual divine energy. Some drift slowly, others remain fixed in the air.

**The Rust Fields** - Industrial wastelands where technology corroded in the Corruption's wake. Factories frozen mid-production, vehicles rusted into sculptures, entire cities turned to oxidized monuments.

**The Ashlands** - Ground zero of the Corelight's destruction. A massive crater hundreds of miles wide, filled with crystalline debris that still pulses with dangerous energy. The air shimmers with reality-warping effects.

**The Verdant Sprawl** - Areas where the Corruption manifested as aggressive, mutated plant growth. Forests that move, flowers that scream, roots that hunger. Nature reclaiming the world with violent intent.

**The Undercities** - Underground ruins and bunker systems where survivors initially fled. Now a maze of tunnels, forgotten vaults, and subterranean settlements.

### The Corruption

The Corruption is the most persistent threat in the post-Fall world. It's not a plague or a poison - it's a fundamental wrongness that spreads through living and non-living matter alike.

**Effects on Life:**
- Animals mutate into aggressive, often intelligent predators
- Plants grow with unnatural speed and hostile intent
- Humans exposed too long lose their minds, becoming Hollowed - empty shells driven by base instincts
- Extended exposure causes physical mutations

**Effects on Matter:**
- Metal rusts and corrodes at accelerated rates
- Stone crumbles to dust
- Water becomes stagnant and toxic
- Divine technology malfunctions in unpredictable ways

**Effects on Reality:**
- Time flows differently in heavily corrupted zones
- Gravity weakens or intensifies randomly
- Memories manifest as ghostly echoes
- The boundary between thought and reality blurs

**The Mystery:**
No one knows what the Corruption truly is. Theories abound:
- Residual divine energy gone wrong
- A weapon used against the Luminarchs
- The Luminarchs' dying curse
- A natural consequence of breaking the Corelight
- Something that existed before, kept at bay by the Corelight's power

### Survivors & Society

Three hundred years after the Fall, pockets of humanity persist. The survivors call themselves **Drifters** - those who wander the shattered world, scavenging, exploring, surviving.

**Population Centers:**
- **Enclaves**: Fortified settlements, usually 100-1,000 people
- **Outposts**: Temporary camps and trading posts
- **Nomad Clans**: Groups that never stay in one place
- **Hidden Sanctuaries**: Secret locations known only to a few

**Social Structure:**
- Traditional government collapsed entirely
- Power belongs to those who control resources
- Factions emerged around different survival philosophies
- Individual reputation matters more than wealth
- Knowledge is the most valuable currency

**Daily Life:**
- Scavenging ruins for working technology and supplies
- Constant vigilance against corrupted creatures
- Trading at outposts for necessities
- Seeking Corelight fragments for their power
- Avoiding or fighting corrupted zones

### Corelight Fragments

Pieces of the shattered Corelight are scattered across the world. These fragments, called **Shards** or **Relics**, retain portions of the Corelight's power:

**Properties:**
- Emit faint, pulsing light
- Warm to the touch, sometimes uncomfortably so
- Resonate with each other when in proximity
- Can power divine technology
- Grant enhanced abilities to those who attune to them
- Seem to "remember" their purpose

**Uses:**
- Power sources for settlements
- Weapons against Corruption
- Keys to sealed ancient vaults
- Focus points for Sync technology
- Objects of worship or study

**Dangers:**
- Prolonged exposure can cause instability
- Attract corrupted creatures
- Sought by all factions, leading to conflict
- Some fragments seem corrupted themselves
- Can drive wielders mad with visions and voices

### Magic & Technology

In the post-Fall world, both magic and technology exist, but both are shadows of their former glory.

**Arcane Magic:**
- Still practiced, but more dangerous and unpredictable
- Requires intense concentration and willpower
- Can backfire catastrophically
- Draws on personal life force
- Easier for those with ancient bloodlines
- Five schools: Elemental, Illusion, Transmutation, Necromancy, Divination

**Divine Technology (Sync Tech):**
- Requires Corelight fragments to power
- No longer responds to thoughts alone
- Prone to malfunctions
- Precious and irreplaceable
- Categories: Weapons, Tools, Medical, Communication, Transportation

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Most successful survivors combine both
- Using magic to stabilize tech
- Using tech to amplify magic
- Creating new combinations unknown before the Fall

## Major Factions

## The Great Questions

These mysteries drive the narrative and player exploration:

1. **What caused the Corelight to shatter?**
   - Was it an attack? A natural limit? Divine abandonment?

2. **Where did the Luminarchs go?**
   - Are they dead? Hidden? Transformed?

3. **What is the Corruption truly?**
   - Enemy? Natural force? Failed divine safeguard?

4. **Can the Corelight be rebuilt?**
   - Should it? What would that mean?

5. **What is humanity's future?**
   - Restoration? Evolution? Extinction? Something new?

## The Player's Role

As a Drifter, players are:
- **Survivors**: Skilled enough to navigate the dangers
- **Seekers**: Driven to find answers and purpose
- **Wild Cards**: Unaligned enough to affect change
- **Witnesses**: Present for pivotal moments
- **Catalysts**: Capable of tipping the balance

The player's journey will reveal truths, force choices, and ultimately determine which vision for humanity's future prevails - or if an entirely new path emerges.
