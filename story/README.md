## Reading Order

### For Implementation:
1. Start with `01-world/world-introduction.md` - understand the setting
2. Read `02-prologue/prologue-outline.md` - see the opening experience
3. Review `03-starting-paths/path-comparison.md` - understand player choices
4. Study each path's content to implement encounters and quests
5. Reference `04-main-arc/arc-overview.md` - for the overarching story

### For Writers:
1. `01-world/` - Establish lore consistency
2. `02-prologue/` - Opening hooks and tone
3. `03-starting-paths/` - Parallel narrative design
4. `04-main-arc/` - Main story beats and convergence

## Story Philosophy

### Core Principles:
- **Player Agency**: Choices matter and have visible consequences
- **Dark Fantasy Tone**: Hope exists but is hard-won
- **Mystery & Discovery**: Players piece together the truth
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No faction is purely good or evil
- **Environmental Storytelling**: The world tells its own story

### Writing Guidelines:
- Keep descriptions vivid but concise
- Use sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch)
- Show character through action and dialogue
- Build tension through pacing
- Reward exploration and curiosity
- Make every choice meaningful

## Key Themes

1. **Loss and Redemption** - What was lost in the Fall, can it be regained?
2. **Technology vs Nature** - The clash between divine tech and corrupted nature
3. **Memory and Identity** - Who were we before? Who are we now?
4. **Survival vs Idealism** - Pragmatism versus hope for something better
5. **Unity vs Division** - Factions split humanity when cooperation is needed
