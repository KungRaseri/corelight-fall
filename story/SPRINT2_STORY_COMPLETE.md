## What We've Created

This sprint focused on establishing the narrative foundation for **The Corelight Fall**. We've created a comprehensive story structure with:

### ✅ Complete World Building

- **The Great Questions** - Driving mysteries for player exploration

### ✅ Complete Prologue
- **Three-Act Structure** - Awakening, Escape, Choice
- **Tutorial Integration** - Teaches mechanics through story

**Seeker's Path (Conclave)**:
- Theme: Truth hidden in ruins
- Tone: Hopeful but complex
- Focus: Lore, magic, mystery
- Key NPC: Sister Aria Lightbringer (kind guide)
- Location: The Sanctum
- Philosophy: Understanding the divine past

### ✅ Main Story Arc (Acts 2-4)

- Truth revealed through shared vision
- Fragment hunt begins

**Act 3: Convergence Accelerates**
- Seven-day countdown to critical mass
- Communications with Luminarch consciousness

## Key Themes Woven Throughout

1. **Identity vs Immortality**
   - What makes us human?
   - Is eternal life worth losing yourself?

   - When does unity become erasure?

3. **Progress vs Preservation**
   - Moving forward vs honoring the past

   - Free will in a world of ancient forces
   - The power and burden of agency

## Tone Calibration

### What This Story Is

### What This Story Isn't
✗ Grimdark nihilism
✗ Preachy or didactic

---

## Success Metrics

### Story Should Make Players

1. **Question their assumptions**
   - About good/evil, progress/tradition, faith/truth

2. **Care about characters**
   - NPCs feel real, relationships matter

3. **Agonize over choices**
   - No easy answers, costs are real

4. **Want to replay**
   - See other paths, try different choices

5. **Remember the experience**
   - Emotional moments stick with them
