        "Username already taken. Please choose another."
2. Character Creation
Flow:
    Introduction:
        Narration:
        "As the last echoes of the divine machine faded, you emerged—marked, yet alive. A drifter in the ruins of a fallen world..."
    Step 1: Name & Appearance:
        Name Input:
            Placeholder: "Enter your chosen name..."
        Appearance Presets:
            Dropdown for archetype (e.g., Worn Survivor, Tech-Scarred Drifter).
            Customize with sliders (height, build, primary aesthetic feature).
    Step 2: Faction Alignment:
        Brief faction summaries displayed as cards:
            Cinderlight Conclave: Ritual and Reawakening
            Forgewalkers Union: Rebuild and Reclaim
            Hollow Creed: Decay and Anarchy

        Confirmation prompt:
